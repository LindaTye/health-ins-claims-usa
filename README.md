#### Description of Dataset

This dataset contains insightful information related to insurance claims, giving us an in-depth look into the demographic patterns of those receiving them. The dataset contains information on patient age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure levels, diabetic status, number of children, smoking status and region. Dataset consists of 1,340 rows and 11 columns.

#### Objective
* The main objective of this project is to predict future insurance claims and identify factors that lead to higher healthcare costs, which could result in significant cost reductions for insurance providers in the USA, and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in machine learning with regards to healthcare insurance claim processing. 

#### Data Cleaning
* Ater data cleaning, 8 rows were removed as the null values from the age and region columns would affect the dataset. The index and patient ID columns were also removed as these were unnecessary for EDA. 

#### Key Insights
* Enhanced Decision-Making with AI: RFR enables better risk assessment, pricing strategies, and targeted health interventions.
* Critical Role of Key Variables: Smoking, BMI, and blood pressure significantly impact insurance claim predictions and policy strategies.
* Improved Efficiency and Cost Savings: AI reduces prediction errors, optimizes claim processing, and drives cost savings.
* Future Opportunities for AI: AI can enhance resource allocation, streamline processes, and ensure fair pricing in USA healthcare insurance.
